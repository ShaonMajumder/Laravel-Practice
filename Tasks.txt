Database Migrations
	Look after DB PORT 3306
	migrations classes : up, down
	migrate command on terminal : php artisan migrate
	Change database schema in all migrations file in laravel.  email to 191
	Drop all the table: failed jobs, password resets, migrations, users
	migrate command on terminal : php artisan migrate . The dropped databases are being recreated
	migrations table holds all the migrations mentioned in migration table
Creating own migration
	Schema::method name - Arguments: table name, closure function(Blueprint object)
	Make Migration:	php artisan make:migration name   . If name includes create_****_table create refers laravel to make a boilerplate to create a new table with the rest of the name. Random name will make random filename with empty methods.
	Instead you can use: php artisan make:migration name_of_file --create=table_name
	php artisan make:migration create_blogposts_table
	php artisan migrate
	schema fascade:
	role back the change: php artisan migrate:rollback . Calling the down methods deleting and rolling back mysql database.
	get rid of changes you have made: delete the unnecessary migrations file, in this case: blogposts table
	To make changes to existing table mention the name of the table with underscore: php artisan make:migration add_content_to_blogposts_table   . Creating table method . If your name doesnt reflect an existing table name use --table suffix. php artisan make:migration add_content --table=blogposts
	In table method, create $table->datatype(name);
	dropColumn(name or array);
	To undo: php artisan migrate:rollback
	To migrate again: php artisan migrate
Laravel Tinker and Eloquent models
	Eloquent: laravel libray called Object Relation Mapping(ORM): php class corsponds to particular table->	fetch the data and store the data
	To make a model: php artisan make:model name.
	php artisan make:model BlogPost  . check at App folder
	to run php file tool : php artisan tinker
